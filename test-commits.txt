# Test commits for the extension

Here are some example commit messages that should trigger the work item and PR linking:

1. "feat: add user authentication AB#1234"
   - Should detect work item 1234
   - Should be categorized as a feature

2. "fix: resolve login validation issue #5678"
   - Should detect work item 5678  
   - Should be categorized as a bug fix

3. "docs: update API documentation work item 9999"
   - Should detect work item 9999
   - Should be categorized as documentation

4. "Merged PR 42: Add OAuth support"
   - Should detect pull request 42
   - Should link the PR

The extension should now:
- Parse work item references in multiple formats
- Generate clickable Azure DevOps links
- Group commits by conventional commit types
- Create comprehensive release notes with all links included
- Handle shallow clones gracefully
- Provide rich templates with proper linking
